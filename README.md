# coding-quiz-challenge

This is a complete refactor of the previous application I created: "js-quiz-game" in order to make the code more dry and effecient.

This web application is designed as a responsive web game for the user to test their knowledge on JavaScript. The user races against the timer, which subtracts ten seconds for every incorrect answer. The user's high scores are recorded so the user can gauge their progress and play against their own best record.
