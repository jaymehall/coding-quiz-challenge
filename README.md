# Coding Quiz Challenge

This is a complete refactor of the previous application ("js-quiz-game") in order to make the code more dry and efficient.

This web application is designed as a responsive web game for the user to test their knowledge on coding. The user races against the timer, which subtracts ten seconds for every incorrect answer. The user's high scores are recorded so the user can gauge their progress and play against their own best record. The Highest Score is stored in client-side storage.
